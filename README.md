II. Descripiton

This project is part of Edmunds GovTech Programming Challenge given to me. I have completed Problems one, 
two and three in this programming challenge. Within each directory (ProblemOne, ProblemTwo, and 
ProblemThree), there is the same structure, as follows:
   
    src          --> this is a folder that contains all of my .java code
    
    pom.xml      --> this is a .xml file which contains all of my dependencies and has the Maven code which 
                     allows this project to be packaged as a jar and ran simply with one command, as shown 
                     later
    
    0-README.txt --> this is a .txt file which contains the commands you can type (when placing yourself 
                     within the directory of the problem you wish to run, ie within ProblemOne directory)
    
    target       --> this is a folder that contains a couple of sub directories
                    
                target/libs              --> this directory has all the .jar dependencies needed for the 
                                              program to run
    
                target/classes           --> this directory has all the .class files that are compiled from
                                              the .java files
            
                target/maven-archiver    --> this directory has the pom.properties file within it
    
                target/maven-status      --> this directory has a bunch of subdirectories for the maven 
                                             compiler

                target/generated-soruces --> this directory has nothing in it but maven automatically
                                             created it
